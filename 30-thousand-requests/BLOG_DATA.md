## Written by: tposejank

Welcome back to Broadcast! As an attempt to use this feature more often, since January 1st, 2024, there have been more than 30 thousand requests made to the Fortnite API!

As of writing, the number is approximately 34 thousand.

### Statistics

With an average of 450 requests per day, I can't thank you enough for preferring FNLookup! The website will continue to improve, and am looking forward to see you in the making of it.

## Why?

This started as a fun project, but sometimes promoting can help. Make sure to promote FNLookup, if you can! It really helps.

Thank you for tuning in!
